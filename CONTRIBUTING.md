# Contributing to iec104ctl

Thank you for your interest in contributing to `iec104ctl`! This document covers the guidelines for contributing.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/iec104ctl.git
   cd iec104ctl
   ```
3. Create a feature branch:
   ```sh
   git checkout -b feature/my-change
   ```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.25+ (see [go.mod](go.mod))
- [staticcheck](https://staticcheck.dev/) and [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/) for linting
- No hardware: the test suite brings its own station (see [Testing](#testing))

### Build & Test

```sh
# Run all checks (format, lint, vet, race tests, coverage gate)
make check

# Run tests with the race detector
make test

# Run tests with whole-module coverage (fails below 85%)
make coverage

# Build for the current platform (./bin/iec104ctl); runs `make check` first
make build
```

Run `make` (or `make help`) for the full list of targets.

## Making Changes

### Code Style

- Follow standard Go conventions (`gofmt`, `go vet`)
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments only where the logic isn't self-evident; comments end with a period (enforced by the linter)

### Formatting

`make fmt` formats with the `gofmt` of the Go version in `go.mod`, which is the version CI uses, not necessarily the one you have installed. `make fmt-check` (part of `make check`) fails if either that `gofmt` or your local one would change a file: `gofmt` output differs slightly between Go releases, and a file the two disagree on fails CI. If they disagree, restructure the code (for example, move trailing comments onto their own lines) rather than picking a side.

### Commit Messages

Use clear, concise commit messages:

```
component: short description

Optional longer explanation of the change, why it was made,
and any relevant context.
```

Examples:
- `monitor: reconnect after a dropped connection`
- `command: refuse a qualifier on a bitstring command`
- `docs: document the station model`

### Testing

- Add tests for new functionality in the appropriate `_test.go` file
- Use [`internal/stationtest`](internal/stationtest) for anything that talks to a station. It serves the simulated station of `iec104ctl server` on a free loopback port, records the events the station logs, and makes throw-away certificates for TLS tests. Command tests run the real command tree through `cmd.Run` and assert on stdout, stderr and the exit code
- Assert behaviour (output, exit code, device state), not just that the code ran
- Tests must not write files into the repository: use `t.TempDir()`
- Do not assume timing a station does not promise: wait for an event with a deadline instead of sleeping
- Keep tests fast and race-clean; CI runs them with `-race` and a 120 s per-package timeout
- Whole-module statement coverage must stay at or above 85% (`make coverage`)
- If your change affects what goes on the wire, verify against a real station or another stack when possible, and say in the pull request what you tested against

### Documentation

When you change commands, flags, output or exit codes, update:

- The command's `Short` / `Long` / `Example` help text
- [README.md](README.md), including the environment variable table for new flags
- [docs/json-output.md](docs/json-output.md) and [docs/exitcodes.md](docs/exitcodes.md) — `--format json` and exit codes are a stable contract for scripts
- [docs/server-config.md](docs/server-config.md) and the commented demo model in `internal/station/demo.go` when the station model changes
- [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md), calling out anything that breaks existing usage

## Submitting Changes

1. Push your branch to your fork:
   ```sh
   git push origin feature/my-change
   ```
2. Open a Pull Request against the `main` branch
3. Describe what your change does and why
4. Reference any related issues

For larger changes, please open an issue first to discuss the approach.

## Reporting Issues

- Use GitHub Issues to report bugs or suggest features
- Include the output of `iec104ctl version` in bug reports
- Provide the exact command that triggered the issue, along with the error output; `--debug` adds every frame sent and received
- Mention the station type and vendor, and whether it sits behind a gateway (the ASDU field sizes matter)
- Report security vulnerabilities privately: see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)
